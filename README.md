Food Demand Forecasting for Food Delivery Company using IBM Cloud

There is a meal delivery company that operates in multiple cities. They have various fulfillment centers in these cities for which dispatch meal orders to their customers. The project aims to help these centers with demand forecasting for upcoming weeks so that these centers can plan the stock of raw materials needed accordingly.
The replenishment of the majority of raw materials is done on weekly basis and since the raw material is perishable, procurement planning is crucial. Secondly, staffing of the centers is also one area wherein accurate demand forecasts are really helpful. Our Machine Learning model will predict the demand for the upcoming 10 weeks for the center-meal combinations in the test set.

I have created a system that predicts food orders with the help of a Machine Learning algorithm that provides more accurate data, a better understanding of food order patterns.
This is beneficial for making better business decisions, helping to solve the food inequity faced by the poor by reducing wastage and improving the ecological balance.
In this project, many steps have been taken to process the data and evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm so that overall the predictions made by the ML model are as accurate as
possible.
The web application made using the flask framework gives the user a convenient and accessible interface to enter input values and get the prediction.
This project is a very good example of how technology and artificial intelligence can be used to make such a large positive impact.
